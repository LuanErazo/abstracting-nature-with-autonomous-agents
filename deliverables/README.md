# Delivery folder instructions

At the end of the workshop this will be the folder where each group delivers its final assets.

Please prepare your files in the following way and place them in this folder.

* Group_1 ðŸ“‚
  * G1_screenshot.png (sketch screenshot)
  * References ðŸ“‚ (include some images from natural elements that inspired you)
  * G1_ecosystem ðŸ“‚
    * Attractor.pde (donâ€™t edit this file)
    * Boundary.pde (donâ€™t edit this file)
    * Creature.pde (don't edit this file, examine closely though)
    * CreatureCustomname.pde (this is where the magic happens, don't forget to apply a custom name!)
    * Food.pde (donâ€™t edit this file)
    * G1_ecosystem.pde (donâ€™t edit this file)
    (youâ€™ve renamed this from generative_ecosystem.pde)
    * World.pde (donâ€™t edit this file)
    * G1_ecosystem (include a compiled executable just in case there is an issue running the code, see below how to do this)
* libraries ðŸ“‚ (located in the repo root, only place the ones that aren't listed yet)


## Making a compiled executable

In your processing application click on File in the dropdown menu and choose Export Application or press `â‡ªâŒ˜E`. Make sure Embed Java is unchecked or your file will be huge.
